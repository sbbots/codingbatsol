First of all, a big thanks goes to the Prof. Nick Parlante for creating such a great offering to devs learning and practicing code.
This project contains all the problems with solutions that I am working on while polishing the concepts and getting back into thinking 
in code.

Please feel free to comment or give suggestions on the code.
